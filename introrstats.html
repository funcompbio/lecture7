## The R project

* The R project at [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org) is an open-source community effort to develop a free software environment, called R, for statistical computing and graphics.

--

* R is also a [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29)
  and currently the _lingua franca_ for statistical research and data analysis.

--

* It was started in 1993 by the statisticians [Ross Ihaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka)
  and [Robert Gentleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_%28statistician%29)
  and has become extremely popular in both academy and industry with an estimated
  users base of one million people worldwide; see
  [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html) 2009 article
  about R in the New York Times.

--

* The R software can be freely downloaded and installed in Linux, Windows and Mac computers from [http://cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)

--

* A new stable version is released every year about march/april and development versions are updated on daily basis. Last major release (version 4.0.0) took place on April, 2020.

---

## Running R in the command line

* You can run R on the terminal window by typing `R` on the Unix shell.

---

## Running R in its default GUI

* You can run R using the default graphical user interface (GUI).

---

## Running R in RStudio

* You can run R using the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) application.

## R packages

* The R functionality is implemented through a number of software add-on
  [_packages_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_package), which divide R
  in two conceptual parts:
  1. The "base" R system with a handful of pre-installed packages.
  2. Everything else: packages written by others or by ourselves.

* To use a package one needs to:
  1. Install the package, just once.
  2. Load the package with the function call `library()`.

* There are thousands of packages contributed by the community and freely available.

* Packages are one of the keys in the success of R, because they are often
  written by the experts who developed the undelying methodology.

---

## R packages

* R Packages can be downloaded and installed from repositories such as

  1. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org](http://cran.r-project.org)
  2. The Bioconductor project at [https://bioconductor.org](https://bioconductor.org)
  3. GitHub at [https://github.com](https://github.com)

* CRAN and Bioconductor can be considered _trusted_ repositories, because
they provide some minimum standards of
[versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning),
[archiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system),
[licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license)
and
[testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing).

* Relying on a package from an _untrusted_ repository, such as a GitHub repo from any given
developer, has the potential pitfall that it may dissapear from one day to the next.

---

## R packages

* R GUIs provide point-and-click interfaces to install packages from trusted repositories.

* The most commonly reported way to install package is by giving the corresponding instruction
in the R shell.

  o For [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), e.g., package [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html):

    ```
    > install.packages("knitr")
    ```
    
  o For [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org), e.g., package [GenomicScores](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicScores):

    ```
    > library(BiocManager) ## install first 'BiocManager' from CRAN
    > install("GenomicScores")
    ```

  o For [GitHub](https://github.com), e.g., package [vilaweb](https://github.com/joebrew/vilaweb) from
    [Joe Brew](https://github.com/joebrew):

    ```
    > library(remotes) ## install first 'remotes' from CRAN
    > install_github("joebrew/vilaweb")
    ```

---

## Session information

* To facilitate reproducing results or reporting errors, it is necessary to
know the specific versions of R and the packages involved in a given data analysis.

* The function `sessionInfo()` reports versions of R and currently loaded and attached
packages:

---

## Concluding remarks (The R project and R packages)

* The R project provides one of the most popular free and open-source platforms for
  analysing data.

* R packages provide a modular and flexible way to extend R's functionality.

* The installation of most R packages is straightforward, however, one should pay
attention to whether the installed package is available in a trusted repository.

* R and its packages are under continuous development. To facilitate error reporting
and reproducibility we should keep track of the R and package versions being used.
